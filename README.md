## ÁVIDA PAGE v2.0

_The Ávida application is a frontend prototype, currently lacking a backend. It addresses biodiversity information and how to reconnect people with it. It provides data on lesser-known native species, migration routes, and natural environments, promoting a mindful connection with the environment. Additionally, it allows users to share opinions, photos, and participate in friendly challenges, thereby contributing to ecological science and community engagement. The goal is to create a community that reduces human impact on endemic ecosystems through information, social awareness, and nature education, **and all this in the same application!**_
